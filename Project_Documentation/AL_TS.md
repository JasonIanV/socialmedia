Defining service endpoints


Thinking
Analyzing task requirements
The request is to create a low-level technical spec for a social media tool like Buffer. It needs to manage posts on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok.
I'm considering the focus on using free and open-source tools for this project. Let's check what the Application Layer involves first.
The Application Layer seems to handle business logic for features like user management and content creation. It also includes scheduling posts and auto-responding to messages, plus analytics.
I'm thinking about how to specify the technical details for these services, including languages and frameworks. This will help keep everything organized and functional.
Since the front end uses React, which is JavaScript-based, I'm leaning towards Node.js for the back end. It keeps the stack consistent and many developers know it.
Node.js should be sufficient for most services, given the expected load. I'm exploring if it can handle file storage and scheduling tasks efficiently.
There are libraries like node-cron for job scheduling in Node.js. I'm also looking at Passport.js for authentication, which supports multiple strategies.
For social media APIs, Node.js can make HTTP requests easily with libraries like Axios. This makes it feasible for platform integrations.
The Application Layer doesn't need to handle platform APIs directly; it can delegate to the Integration Layer. This simplifies things, letting it focus on business logic.
For data storage, the Application Layer will use a database interface via the Data Access Layer. I'm considering Mongoose for MongoDB or Sequelize for PostgreSQL in Node.js.
NoSQL databases are good for unstructured data, like content with images and videos. They handle large amounts of data flexibly, which fits our needs.
To keep things simple, I'll assume the Data Access Layer uses a relational database, with file storage handled separately. This approach balances structure and flexibility.
Defining service endpoints
I'm outlining endpoints for the User Service, starting with registration and login. This includes POST /api/user/signup and POST /api/user/login, plus GET /api/user/me for user info.
Now, I'm adding endpoints for team management in the User Service. This covers listing teams, creating teams, and updating team details, like GET /api/teams and POST /api/teams.
The Account Service needs endpoints for connecting social media accounts. I'm thinking about GET /api/accounts to list all accounts and POST /api/accounts/connect/:platform to start the connection.
I'm also adding endpoints for managing account collaborators in the Account Service. This includes DELETE /api/accounts/:accountId/collaborators/:userId to remove a collaborator.
For the Account Service, I'm considering how to handle the authorization flow. It might need platform-specific libraries or manual HTTP requests, but let's see.
The Account Service will call the Integration Layer's methods for each platform, like using the Facebook Integrator to get an authorization URL. This keeps things organized and platform-specific.
For the Content Service, I'm defining endpoints like POST /api/content to create new content. This will include handling text, images, and videos, which is key for our tool.
When deleting content, I need to ensure associated files are removed too. This prevents orphaned files and keeps storage clean.
The Scheduling Service needs an endpoint for recommended posting times. I'm adding GET /api/schedules/recommendations/:accountId to get suggestions based on analytics.
The Message Responder Service manages auto-responses for messages. I'm outlining endpoints like creating rules and handling notifications from the Integration Layer.
For Facebook and Instagram, auto-responses are fully automated via APIs. TikTok requires assisted setup, so users must set up replies manually through the app.
The Message Responder Service needs to listen for notifications from the Integration Layer. It will parse messages, check rules, and send responses using the appropriate integrator.
I'm defining endpoints for the Analytic Service now. This includes GET /api/analytics/accounts/:accountId for account metrics and GET /api/analytics/reports for custom reports.
The Analytic Service will collect and process performance data from social media platforms. It might also perform aggregation or analysis to provide insights, which is helpful for users.
The Integration Layer will have platform-specific classes, like a FacebookIntegrator for API calls. I'm looking into using official SDKs or Axios for these interactions.
The Queue Service will use Bull Queue to manage tasks, ensuring API calls respect rate limits. This helps with scheduling posts and sending auto-responses efficiently.
I'm organizing endpoints under /api/serviceName for clarity. For instance, /api/user/* for User Service and /api/accounts/* for Account Service, which makes navigation easier.
I need to ensure all API endpoints have authentication and authorization checks. This means verifying user permissions before actions like creating accounts or managing teams.
To handle security, I'm thinking about adding a utility function to check user permissions for each action. This will keep access control consistent across services.
Each service interacts with the Data Access Layer for data storage and the Integration Layer for platform interactions. This keeps responsibilities clear and organized.
The Content Service handles file storage separately, storing metadata in the database. This approach works well for managing images and videos efficiently.
Each service should handle errors gracefully, providing meaningful messages to users. I'm considering using Winston for logging errors and important events, which aids debugging.
For internationalization, if needed, I can use a library like i18n-node. This ensures the application supports multiple languages, making it more accessible.
I'm wrapping up by structuring the spec to include the programming language, frameworks, API endpoints, and service interactions. This will give a clear picture for implementation.
The spec will also cover security and performance considerations, ensuring the tool is robust and scalable. Let's make sure everything is covered before finalizing.
I'm finalizing the tech stack for the Application Layer. Express.js will be the web framework, and PostgreSQL with Sequelize will handle database interactions.
The User Service endpoints include managing team roles, like PUT /api/teams/:teamId/members/:memberId/role. This ensures proper access control within teams.
The Account Service endpoints cover getting account details and updating information. This includes GET /api/accounts/:accountId and PUT /api/accounts/:accountId, which are essential for management.
The Scheduling Service endpoints include creating and updating scheduled posts. This covers POST /api/schedules and PUT /api/schedules/:scheduleId, which are crucial for post management.
Key Points
Research suggests using Node.js for the Application Layer, with Express.js as the web framework, focusing on free and open-source tools.
