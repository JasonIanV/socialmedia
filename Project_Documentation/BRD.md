Key Points
The application will manage social media across Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, with features for scheduling posts and auto-responding to messages.

Survey Note: Detailed Business Requirement Document for Social Media Management Application
This comprehensive survey note outlines the detailed requirements for a social media management application similar to Buffer, focusing on automating social media management across Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, with the added capability to auto-respond to messages. The document is structured to ensure clarity and completeness, addressing all aspects identified through extensive research into platform capabilities and best practices.

Introduction and Scope
The application, tentatively named [To be determined], is designed to assist users in managing their social media presence across Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. It will enable automated scheduling of posts, content creation, auto-responding to messages, analytics, team collaboration, integrations, security, and a user-friendly experience. The scope includes handling both personal and business accounts, with specific attention to platform limitations, especially for TikTok's messaging features.

Detailed Requirements by Feature
1. Account Management
The application must allow users to connect and manage multiple social media accounts from Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. This includes:

Connecting accounts using authorized methods (e.g., API keys, oAuth) for each platform.
Supporting both personal and business accounts, noting differences in API access, such as TikTok's business account features.
Enabling users to add, remove, and manage accounts, with the ability to categorize them using user-defined tags or categories for organization.
Research into platform APIs, such as Buffer: Social media management for everyone, confirms the need for robust account management to handle multiple profiles efficiently.

2. Content Scheduling
Content scheduling is a core feature, requiring:

A user-friendly interface for creating and scheduling posts, supporting different content types specific to each platform (e.g., text, images, videos for Facebook; posts, stories, reels for Instagram; primarily videos for TikTok).
The ability to schedule posts at specific times or use optimal time suggestions based on historical engagement data, as suggested by 30+ Social Media Best Practices To Follow in 2025 - SocialBee.
A calendar view to display all scheduled posts, allowing filtering by account or platform, with options to edit or delete posts before publication.
Platform-specific considerations include Instagram's restrictions on third-party scheduling for certain content types and TikTok's focus on video content, as noted in Buffer Review [2025] - Is The Free Social Media Tool Plan Enough?.

3. Content Creation
The application must provide tools for content creation, including:

Basic editing capabilities for text, images (e.g., cropping, resizing, adding text), and videos (e.g., trimming, adding captions).
Integration with external design tools like Canva, allowing users to import designs directly, enhancing creativity as per 11 Features We Love About Buffer, Our Social Media Scheduling Tool.
A content library to store and reuse content, with tagging and searching capabilities for efficient management.
This feature ensures users can prepare content in platform-appropriate formats, such as Instagram's 9:16 aspect ratio for stories, as identified in the research.

4. Auto-Responding to Messages
Auto-responding is a critical feature, with varying levels of automation across platforms:

For Facebook and Instagram, the application will fully automate responses through API integration. Research, such as Use Meta API to Send Messages to Users via Facebook Messenger | by Suminda Niroshan | Medium, confirms the availability of Messenger API for sending messages, and Guide to Using Instagram Messenger for Business - Brevo highlights Instagram's Direct Messaging API for similar functionality.
For TikTok, due to the lack of official API support for direct message management, as seen in Getting Direct Messages via Official TikTok API - Stack Overflow, the application will assist in setting up auto-replies. Users must apply these through TikTok's app, utilizing the business account's keyword-triggered auto-reply feature, as detailed in TikTok for Business: How to Create Keyword Auto-Reply Messages - Adweek.
Users can define custom response templates based on keywords or user types, with the application handling platform rate limits to avoid penalties, ensuring compliance with terms of service.
This approach addresses the complexity of TikTok's limitations, providing a practical solution for users.

5. Analytics and Reporting
Analytics are essential for tracking performance, requiring:

Collection and display of performance metrics for each post (e.g., likes, comments, shares, views), tailored to each platform's capabilities, as seen in Buffer Review | Pricing & Features (2025) - Social Media Marketing Platform.
Availability of aggregate reports across all accounts and platforms, with custom report generation based on date ranges, platforms, or accounts.
Insights into trends such as engagement, follower growth, and optimal posting times, supporting strategic decision-making as per 50 Social Media Best Practices Every Business Should Follow - CoSchedule.
6. Team Collaboration
To facilitate teamwork, the application must:

Support inviting team members with role-based access (e.g., admin, editor, viewer), each with specific permissions for account management, content creation, scheduling, and analytics viewing.
Provide a shared content library for collaboration, with commenting and approval workflows for posts before scheduling or publishing, aligning with best practices from 24 Social Media Best Practices From Industry Experts - Social Insider.
7. Integrations
The application should enhance functionality through:

Integration with common business tools like CRM systems and email marketing platforms, improving workflow efficiency, as noted in Buffer review 2025: features, pros and cons, and pricing - HypeGig.
Provision of an API for custom integrations, allowing developers to extend functionality, as seen in 12 Best Buffer Alternatives to Boost Social Media Presence - SocialPilot.
8. Security and Compliance
Security is paramount, requiring:

Secure data storage with encryption for sensitive information, and authentication options including two-factor authentication, as recommended by Social Media Best Practices - Communications - Tufts.
Compliance with each platform's API terms regarding data usage and privacy, ensuring adherence to legal standards like GDPR, as identified in the research.
9. User Experience
To ensure usability, the application must:

Offer an intuitive and user-friendly interface, responsive on both desktop and mobile devices, as per 19 social media best practices for faster growth - Hootsuite.
Provide help documentation, tutorials, and customer support, with regular updates and feature enhancements based on user feedback, enhancing user satisfaction.
Additional Considerations
The application must handle platform-specific requirements, such as Instagram's restrictions on third-party scheduling and TikTok's video-centric content. For TikTok, the auto-responding feature's limitation to manual setup through the app is a notable constraint, but the application will provide assistance to mitigate this, ensuring users can still leverage platform features effectively. Scalability is also crucial, with the design supporting multiple users and accounts efficiently.
