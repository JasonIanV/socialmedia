Researching front end specs
The request is for a low-level technical specification for a social media management app's front end. I'm considering which programming language and frameworks would work best for this.
The front end handles the user interface for managing social media, creating content, and viewing analytics, and needs to work on desktop and mobile. I'm thinking a web application would be the most accessible option for users on different devices.
Given the need for a modern, responsive UI, I'm looking at JavaScript frameworks like React and Angular, both of which are free and open-source. Both have large communities, which is great for support and resources.
React seems popular for its flexibility and component-based architecture, which could fit a feature-rich social media tool. Angular offers built-in features like routing, which might simplify development.
For team collaboration, the front end likely needs endpoints to manage team members and their roles, like adding or removing members. I'm thinking about how these features will integrate with the User Service.
Now, I'm exploring specific endpoints the front end might need, such as GET /me for current user info and POST /teams/{teamId}/members to add team members. This will help define how users interact with team features.
The Account Service manages connections to social media accounts, so the front end needs to handle which users access which accounts. I'm considering how to manage account ownership and permissions through endpoints.
Perhaps users can be part of teams, and each team has access to certain accounts, based on the high-level architecture. I'm trying to clarify the relationship between users, teams, and accounts to ensure the front end design makes sense.
Account owners should be able to manage collaborators for their accounts through the front end. I'm thinking the Account Service could handle adding or removing collaborators with specific endpoints.
Possible endpoints include GET /accounts/{accountId}/collaborators to list collaborators and POST /accounts/{accountId}/collaborators to add new ones. This will help define how collaboration works in the app.
The Account Service also needs endpoints for managing accounts, like connecting or disconnecting them. I'm considering how the front end will initiate authentication flows with social media platforms.
For account management, endpoints like GET /accounts to list all connected accounts and POST /accounts/connect/{platform} to start connecting a new account seem useful. This will ensure users can manage their social media connections easily.
The Content Service will have endpoints for creating, updating, and retrieving content, such as GET /content for listing items and POST /content for creating new ones. I'm thinking about how the front end will handle different content types like text, images, and videos.
For content creation, the front end might offer tools like rich text editors for text or image editors for visuals. I'm focusing on API endpoints for creating, updating, and retrieving content items.
The Scheduling Service manages posting times, so the front end needs to let users pick content, accounts, and schedules. I'm considering adding a calendar view for visualizing all scheduled posts.
For the Message Responder Service, I'm looking at endpoints like GET /auto-responses to list rules and POST /auto-responses to create new ones for Facebook and Instagram. This will help users set up auto-replies easily.
For TikTok auto-replies, the front end might just need a UI section with instructions, since it's assisted setup. I'm thinking there's no need for specific endpoints, maybe just storing user notes.
The Analytic Service will have endpoints for retrieving metrics, like GET /analytics/accounts/{accountId} for account analytics. I'm considering how the front end can display this data in dashboards or reports.
Users might want to filter or customize reports, so endpoints could include query parameters for criteria. I'm thinking about how to make reporting flexible for different needs.
For simplicity, I'm assuming the front end makes standard HTTP requests to the Application Layer's APIs, not handling webhooks directly. The back end can notify the front end via socket connections or polling if needed.
Since I've chosen React, I'm looking at libraries like Axios for HTTP requests, as it offers more features than the fetch API, like better error handling. This will make API calls smoother for the front end.
React-Redux is widely used for managing global state, which could help with this app's complex features. I'm considering if it's better than using React's context API with useReducer for simpler state management.
For routing, React Router seems like the standard choice for React apps, which would keep navigation smooth. I'm thinking about how it fits with the app's structure.
For form handling, Formik is popular and provides validation, which could make user inputs easier. I'm considering how it will integrate with React for a seamless experience.
For date and time selection, libraries like React Datepicker could improve the UI. I'm thinking about how these tools will enhance scheduling features for users.
Authentication will use JSON Web Tokens for user login and logout. I'm planning to store tokens locally using standard JavaScript APIs for managing cookies or local storage.
For styling, Material UI is popular and offers pre-designed components, which could save time. I'm considering if its design language fits the app, or if React-Bootstrap might be a better generic option.
Material UI is well-documented and feature-rich, making it a solid choice for responsive design. I'm thinking its grid system and components will help adapt the layout for desktop and mobile.
There's a lot here, so I'm keeping internationalization in mind, like using React-Intl for multiple languages, though the request didn't specify it. It could be useful if the app grows later.
Testing is crucial, so I'm considering libraries like Jest and React Testing Library for unit tests. For end-to-end tests, tools like Cypress could work, though I won't detail it much in the spec.
I'm reviewing the endpoints for user and team management to ensure they cover all operations. GET /users/me for current user info and POST /users/logout for logging out seem essential for user interactions.
Endpoints like POST /teams/{teamId}/members for adding team members and DELETE /teams/{teamId}/members/{memberId} for removing them fit under the User Service. I'm ensuring these align with the high-level architecture.
For account management, DELETE /accounts/{accountId} lets users disconnect accounts, which is part of the Account Service. I'm making sure all account-related operations are covered.
The Content Service needs endpoints like GET /content/{contentId} to fetch specific content details and PUT /content/{contentId} to update items. I'm ensuring these cover all content management needs.
For auto-response rules, I'm specifying endpoints like POST /auto-responses to create rules for Facebook and Instagram, including platform, account ID, conditions, and response template. This will help users set up automated replies easily.
Each service might have its own API endpoint prefix, like /api/user for User Service or /api/accounts for Account Service. I'm thinking this structure will keep the API organized and scalable.
I'm considering security for the front end, focusing on authentication and authorization. Users need to log in, and their requests should include tokens to verify identity, stored securely in local storage or cookies.
After login, the front end can fetch user permissions and adjust the UI. I'm thinking this will ensure only authorized actions are shown to users.
For file uploads, the Content Service needs endpoints accepting multipart form data. I'm considering using Axios to send files securely, handling progress and errors for large uploads.
All recommended libraries, like React and Axios, are free and open-source, aligning with the request. Some might offer paid support, but basic usage is free, which should be fine.
The front end will use React, with libraries like Axios for HTTP requests and React-Redux for state management. I'm ensuring all tools fit the project's needs and are open-source.
It will call APIs from services like User Service for team management and Account Service for account collaboration. I'm making sure the endpoints cover all necessary operations for users.
I'm specifying React as the front-end framework due to its flexibility and extensive ecosystem. This choice aligns with the need for a modern, responsive UI for the social media management app.
Endpoints for the User Service include GET /api/teams to list teams and POST /api/teams to create new ones. This will help users manage team structures effectively.
For the Content Service, GET /api/content lists all content items, which is key for users to manage their posts. POST /api/content lets them create new content, covering essential operations.
OK, let's check the Scheduling Service endpoints, like GET /api/schedules for listing scheduled posts and POST /api/schedules for creating new ones. This will help users plan their social media posts easily.
Key Points
Research suggests using React for the front end, with libraries like React-Redux for state management and Material UI for styling, focusing on free and open-source tools.
It seems likely that the front end will call various API endpoints for user management, account handling, content creation, scheduling, auto-responses, and analytics, with JWT for authentication.
The evidence leans toward using Axios for HTTP requests, Formik for forms, and Chart.js for analytics charts, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface.
