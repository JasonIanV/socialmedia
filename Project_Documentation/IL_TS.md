Different queues for different platforms (e.g., facebook-queue, instagram-queue), each with rate limits set based on platform policies.
Methods include enqueueTask(queueName, taskData, rateLimit) to add tasks and processQueue(queueName) to handle task execution.
Code Structure
The Integration Layer will be organized as follows in the codebase:

integrators/
facebook.js: Facebook Integrator class with methods and webhook setup.
instagram.js: Instagram Integrator class with methods and webhook setup.
tiktok.js: TikTok Integrator class with methods, no webhooks.
external.js: External Integrator class with generic methods.
queue.js: Queue Service module with queue management functions.
Each integrator class will have methods for performing actions and a method like setupWebhooks(app) to set up necessary routes on the Express.js app, ensuring the Application Layer can call these methods and the main server handles webhooks.

Security and Additional Considerations
Authentication: Each integrator handles platform-specific authentication, managing access tokens and refresh tokens, stored securely in the Data Access Layer. For example, Facebook uses OAuth 2.0, Instagram uses Instagram Business API authentication, and TikTok uses Marketing API authentication.
Error Handling: Robust error handling for API calls, managing cases like rate limits exceeded, invalid tokens, or network errors, logging errors using libraries like Winston for debugging.
Verification: Webhooks must verify requests from platforms using platform-specific methods, such as signature verification for Facebook Messenger and Instagram, ensuring legitimacy of incoming requests.
Retry Mechanisms: Tasks enqueued in the Queue Service can be configured for retries if they fail due to temporary issues, enhancing reliability.
