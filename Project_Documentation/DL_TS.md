Key Points
Research suggests using PostgreSQL for the database, with sequelize as the ORM in Node.js, focusing on free and open-source tools.
It seems likely that the Data Access Layer will manage tables for users, teams, accounts, content, schedules, auto-responses, and analytics, with methods for CRUD operations.
The evidence leans toward encrypting sensitive data and ensuring GDPR compliance for data privacy.
Database and Framework
The Data Access Layer uses PostgreSQL as the relational database, chosen for its ability to handle structured data with clear relationships. It interacts with Node.js using sequelize, a free and open-source ORM, ensuring efficient data operations.

Schema and Security
The layer includes tables for users, teams, accounts, content, scheduled posts, auto-response rules, and analytics, with encrypted storage for sensitive data like credentials. It ensures compliance with legal standards like GDPR for data privacy.

Methods for Application Layer
The layer provides methods for each service, such as creating users, connecting accounts, and retrieving analytics, allowing the Application Layer to perform necessary database operations without direct database access.

Detailed Technical Specification for Data Access Layer
This comprehensive note outlines the detailed low-level technical specification for the Data Access Layer of a social media management application, focusing on managing the storage and retrieval of data securely and efficiently. The specification covers the database choice, libraries, schema design, security measures, and methods provided for the Application Layer, ensuring alignment with best practices for social media management tools as of 10:39 AM PDT on Monday, March 24, 2025.

Introduction and Scope
The Data Access Layer is responsible for managing the storage and retrieval of data, ensuring secure and efficient data handling for the social media management application. It supports features like user management, account connections, content creation, post scheduling, auto-responding to messages, and analytics across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok. The layer interacts with the Application Layer to provide necessary database operations and ensures compliance with security and legal standards, focusing on free and open-source tools.

Database and Framework Selection
The database choice is PostgreSQL, a free and open-source relational database management system, selected for its ability to handle structured data with clear relationships, as noted in PostgreSQL - The World's Most Advanced Open Source Relational Database. This is suitable for storing user data, account information, content, scheduled posts, and analytics data, given the structured nature of most data in the application.

For database interaction in Node.js, the ORM library chosen is sequelize, a free and open-source ORM under the MIT license, supporting PostgreSQL among other databases, as detailed in Sequelize - The Node.js ORM for PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite and more. Sequelize provides features like migrations and seeders, which are crucial for managing schema changes and initial data, ensuring flexibility and maintainability.

The programming language for the Data Access Layer is Node.js, ensuring consistency with other layers of the application, facilitating development and integration.

Schema Design
The database schema includes tables for managing various entities, with relationships defined to reflect the application's structure. Below is a detailed breakdown:

Tables
Users
user_id (primary key, UUID)
email (string, unique, not null)
password (string, hashed, not null)
role (string, e.g., 'admin', 'user', not null)

Relationships: Many-to-one with Accounts, optional many-to-one with Scheduled Posts (via post_id).
This schema design accommodates the structured nature of most data, with JSON fields for flexibility in content and analytics, ensuring the system can handle platform-specific requirements without frequent schema changes.

Security Measures
Security is paramount, with the following measures implemented:

Encryption: Sensitive data like credentials in the Accounts table will be encrypted using Node.js's crypto library, ensuring compliance with Social Media Best Practices - Communications - Tufts. Passwords in the Users table will be hashed using bcrypt, a free and open-source library under the MIT license, as noted in bcrypt - A library to help you hash passwords.
Access Controls: PostgreSQL will be configured with role-based access controls, restricting database access to only necessary operations, and using SSL for database connections to ensure data in transit is secure.
Compliance: The system will comply with legal standards like GDPR for data privacy, ensuring user data is handled appropriately, as recommended by Buffer review 2025: features, pros and cons, and pricing - HypeGig. This includes implementing data retention policies and providing mechanisms for users to request data deletion.

Additional Considerations
File Storage: For content with media (images, videos), files will be stored on the server's file system, with paths stored in the Content table. Access to files will be controlled via the Application Layer, ensuring security.
Testing: For development, an in-memory database like SQLite can be used for unit tests, with PostgreSQL for integration tests, ensuring reliability.
Backup and Recovery: While not part of the specification, it's recommended to configure regular backups of the PostgreSQL database and implement disaster recovery plans for operational continuity.
Tables for Clarity
Below is a table summarizing the auto-responding capabilities by platform, which impacts the Auto-Response Rules table design:

Platform	Auto-Responding Capability	Notes
Facebook	Fully automated via Messenger API	Supports custom templates and keyword-based responses.
Instagram	Fully automated via Direct Messaging API	Integrates with CRM systems for streamlined communication.
TikTok	Assisted setup, manual application through app	Users set up keyword-triggered replies via TikTok's business features.
Another table for content type support, aiding in Content table design:

Platform	Supported Content Types	Notes
Facebook	Text, images, videos, links, events	Flexible post formats, including potential stories.
Instagram	Posts, stories, reels (images, videos)	Restrictions on third-party scheduling for stories may apply.
TikTok	Primarily videos, some images	Focus on video content, with scheduling through API.
These tables ensure a clear understanding of platform-specific features, guiding the implementation of the Data Access Layer.
